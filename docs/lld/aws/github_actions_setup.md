## GitHub Secrets Configuration

GitHub Secrets store sensitive credentials that the CI/CD workflows use to deploy to AWS.

### Where to Add Secrets

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/ansari-project/ansari-whatsapp`
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**

### Required Secrets

#### AWS Credentials (Reuse from ansari-backend)

| Secret Name | Description | How to Get |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Access key for `app-runner-github-actions-user` | From ansari-backend GitHub Secrets (or AWS IAM Console) |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Secret key for `app-runner-github-actions-user` | From ansari-backend GitHub Secrets (or AWS IAM Console) |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region where resources are deployed | `us-west-2` |

**Note:** These credentials are from the IAM user `app-runner-github-actions-user` created for ansari-backend. The user has permissions for ECR push and App Runner deployments.

#### IAM Role ARNs

| Secret Name | Description | How to Get |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `SERVICE_ROLE_ARN` | ARN of `CustomAppRunnerServiceRole` | `aws iam get-role --role-name CustomAppRunnerServiceRole --query 'Role.Arn' --output text` |
| `INSTANCE_ROLE_ARN` | ARN of `CustomAppRunnerInstanceRole` | `aws iam get-role --role-name CustomAppRunnerInstanceRole --query 'Role.Arn' --output text` |

**Example ARN format:**
- Service Role: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CustomAppRunnerServiceRole`
- Instance Role: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CustomAppRunnerInstanceRole`

#### SSM Parameter Store Paths

| Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `SSM_ROOT_STAGING` | `/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/staging/` | Path prefix for staging environment variables |
| `SSM_ROOT_PRODUCTION` | `/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/production/` | Path prefix for production environment variables |

**Important:** Include the trailing slash!

#### Optional: Environment-Specific Overrides

These are optional and mainly for testing different configurations:

| Secret Name | Default | When to Override |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| `LOGGING_LEVEL_STAGING` | `INFO` | To enable DEBUG logging in staging |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL_PRODUCTION` | `INFO` | Generally keep at INFO or WARNING |

## Workflow Overview

Two GitHub Actions workflows handle deployments:

### 1. Staging Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Automatic: Push to `develop` branch
- Manual: Workflow dispatch from GitHub Actions UI

**What it does:**
1. Builds Docker image with uv
2. Tags image with git commit SHA
3. Pushes to ECR `ansari-whatsapp` repository
4. Deploys to `ansari-whatsapp-staging` App Runner service
5. Injects environment variables from SSM path: `/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/staging/*`

**Typical use case:**
- Merge a PR to `develop` branch
- Automatically deploys to staging
- Test the changes before promoting to production

### 2. Production Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Automatic: Push to `main` branch
- Manual: Workflow dispatch from GitHub Actions UI

**What it does:**
1. Same build and push process as staging
2. Deploys to `ansari-whatsapp-production` App Runner service
3. Injects environment variables from SSM path: `/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/production/*`

**Typical use case:**
- Merge `develop` into `main` after testing
- Automatically deploys to production
- Real users receive the update

## How Deployments Work

### The Deployment Pipeline

```
1. Developer pushes to develop/main
            â†“
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers
            â†“
3. Checkout repository code
            â†“
4. Configure AWS credentials (using secrets)
            â†“
5. Login to Amazon ECR
            â†“
6. Build Docker image
   - Uses Dockerfile with uv
   - Tags with git SHA: <ecr-url>/ansari-whatsapp:<sha>
            â†“
7. Push image to ECR
            â†“
8. Deploy to App Runner
   - Uses awslabs/amazon-app-runner-deploy action
   - References SSM parameters for env vars
   - Waits up to 20 minutes for deployment
            â†“
9. Output App Runner URL
```

### Environment Variable Injection

The workflows use a clever pattern to inject environment variables from SSM:

```yaml
env:
  BACKEND_SERVER_URL: ${{ format('{0}{1}', secrets.SSM_ROOT_STAGING, 'backend-server-url') }}
```

This concatenates:
- `SSM_ROOT_STAGING` = `/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/staging/`
- `'backend-server-url'` = parameter name

Result: `/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/staging/backend-server-url`

App Runner reads this path from SSM and injects the value as `BACKEND_SERVER_URL` environment variable.

### Docker Image Tagging Strategy

Images are tagged with the git commit SHA:

```
<account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ansari-whatsapp:a1b2c3d4
```

**Benefits:**
- Exact version tracking (which git commit is deployed)
- Easy rollbacks (just redeploy an older SHA)
- No "latest" tag confusion

### Deployment Timing

**Staging deployment:**
- Build time: ~2-3 minutes
- Push to ECR: ~30 seconds
- App Runner deployment: ~5-7 minutes
- **Total: ~8-10 minutes**

**Production deployment:**
- Same timing as staging
- **Total: ~8-10 minutes**

**Why so long?**
- App Runner provisions new instances
- Health checks must pass before switching traffic
- Zero-downtime deployment (old version runs until new version is healthy)

## Workflow File Structure

### Staging Workflow Highlights

```yaml
name: Staging Deployment (AWS App Runner)

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging-aws  # GitHub Environment for approval gates (optional)

    steps:
      # ... build and push steps ...

      - name: Deploy to App Runner
        uses: awslabs/amazon-app-runner-deploy@main
        with:
          service: ansari-whatsapp-staging
          image: ${{ steps.build-image.outputs.image }}
          access-role-arn: ${{ secrets.SERVICE_ROLE_ARN }}
          instance-role-arn: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_ROLE_ARN }}

## Manual Deployment Trigger

You can manually trigger deployments without pushing code:

### From GitHub UI

1. Go to **Actions** tab in the repository
2. Select the workflow (Staging or Production Deployment)
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select the branch
5. Click **Run workflow** button

### Use Cases for Manual Triggers

- **Environment variable update**: You changed an SSM parameter and want to redeploy
- **Emergency rollback**: Manually trigger an older commit
- **Testing**: Deploy a feature branch to staging without merging
- **Hotfix**: Deploy directly to production (use with caution!)

---

## Monitoring Deployments

### GitHub Actions UI

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the running workflow
3. Expand steps to see detailed logs
4. Look for errors in red

**Key steps to monitor:**
- âœ… Build, tag, and push image to ECR
- âœ… Deploy to App Runner
- âœ… App Runner URL output

### AWS Console

1. Go to AWS Console â†’ App Runner
2. Select your service (`ansari-whatsapp-staging` or `ansari-whatsapp-production`)
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. See deployment status and history

**Deployment statuses:**
- ðŸ”µ **In progress**: Deployment is running
- ðŸŸ¢ **Successful**: Deployment completed, service is healthy
- ðŸ”´ **Failed**: Deployment failed (check logs)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Rolled back**: Deployment failed and was automatically rolled back

### CloudWatch Logs

1. AWS Console â†’ App Runner â†’ Your Service
2. Click **Logs** tab
3. See application logs in real-time

**Log groups:**
- `/aws/apprunner/ansari-whatsapp-staging/service`
- `/aws/apprunner/ansari-whatsapp-production/service`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Repository does not exist or no pull access"

**Cause:** GitHub Actions can't access ECR repository

**Fix:**
1. Verify ECR repository `ansari-whatsapp` exists:
   ```bash
   aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names ansari-whatsapp \
     --profile ansari --region us-west-2
   ```
2. Check `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secrets are correct
3. Verify IAM user has ECR push permissions

### Issue: "Parameter not found"

**Cause:** SSM parameter doesn't exist or path is wrong

**Fix:**
1. Check `SSM_ROOT_STAGING` or `SSM_ROOT_PRODUCTION` secret has trailing slash
2. Verify parameters exist:
   ```bash
   aws ssm get-parameters-by-path \
     --path "/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/staging" \
     --profile ansari --region us-west-2
   ```
3. Create missing parameters using commands in [aws-cli.md](./aws-cli.md)

### Issue: "Service failed to start"

**Cause:** App Runner can't start the container

**Fix:**
1. Check Dockerfile is correct
2. Verify `PORT=8001` is set
3. Check health check endpoint `GET /` returns 200
4. Review App Runner logs in AWS Console

### Issue: "AccessDenied when calling AssumeRole"

**Cause:** Instance role doesn't have permission to read SSM parameters

**Fix:**
1. Verify `CustomAppRunnerInstanceRole` has policy attached:
   ```bash
   aws iam list-role-policies --role-name CustomAppRunnerInstanceRole \
     --profile ansari --region us-west-2
   ```
2. Check policy allows `ssm:GetParameter*` on `/app-runtime/ansari-whatsapp/*`
3. See [instance-role-parameters-access.json](./instance-role-parameters-access.json)

### Issue: "No output from deployment"

**Cause:** Workflow completes but doesn't show App Runner URL

**Fix:**
- This is normal if the service already existed
- URL doesn't change between deployments
- Find URL in AWS Console â†’ App Runner â†’ Service Details

## Best Practices

### Before Deploying

- [ ] All tests pass in CI
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] SSM parameters verified
- [ ] Staging deployed and tested
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code

### After Deploying

- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] Check logs for errors
- [ ] Send test WhatsApp message
- [ ] Monitor error rates in CloudWatch
- [ ] Update Meta webhook URL if needed

### Emergency Procedures

**If production is broken:**
1. Immediately revert the Git commit:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```
2. OR manually rollback in AWS Console
3. OR update Meta webhook to point to staging temporarily

**Communication:**
- Notify team in Slack/Discord
- Update status page if applicable
- Document the incident for post-mortem

---

## Next Steps

After configuring secrets:

1. Test staging deployment first:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger staging deployment"
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. Monitor the deployment in GitHub Actions

3. Once successful, test production:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge develop
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Update Meta webhook URL to production App Runner URL

**You're all set! ðŸš€**
