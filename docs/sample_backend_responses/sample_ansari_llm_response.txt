## الخلاصة (Summary)

These verses and hadiths emphasize the fundamental Islamic principle that **النية** (intention) is the cornerstone of all deeds.  [5] The famous hadith states: "Actions are but by the intention and every man will have but that which he intended," establishing that the value and reward of any action depends entirely on the sincerity and purity of one's intention.

 [6] The Quran declares that "sincere devotion is due ˹only˺ to Allah," and  [7] commands us to "worship Allah ˹alone˺ with sincere devotion to Him in all uprightness." This teaches us that all our deeds, whether acts of worship or worldly activities, should be performed with the pure intention of seeking Allah's pleasure alone.
